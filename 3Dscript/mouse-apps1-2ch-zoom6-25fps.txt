At frame 0:
- change all channels' intensity to (1.0, 100.0, 1.0)
- change all channels' alpha to (1.0, 100, 2.0)
- change channel 1 color to (255.0, 0.0, 0.0)
- change channel 2 color to (0.0, 255.0, 255.0)
- change channel 1 weight to 1.0
- change channel 2 weight to 0.0
- change rendering algorithm to independent transparency
- change background color to (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
- change all channels' front/back clipping to (-808, 808)
- reset transformation 
- rotate by -5 degrees around (0, 1, 0)
- change bounding box visibility to off
- change scalebar length to 250
- change scalebar width to 4
- change scalebar visibility to on

// overview: rotate and see channels
From frame 0 to frame 125:
- rotate by 360 degrees horizontally ease-out 
- change channel 2 weight to 1.0
- change channel 1 weight to 0.0

At frame 126:
- change all channels' weight to 1.0

// Zoom-in
From frame 127 to frame 250:
- zoom by a factor of 6.0 ease-in
- translate by (24064.0, -8234.9, 0.0) ease-in

// Scroll through planes. 
// Diff. betw front/back clipping pl should be at least z-step, eg 10 (um)
From frame 251 to frame 300:
- change all channels' front/back clipping to (-290, -280) ease-in-out 
From frame 300 to frame 600:
- change all channels' front/back clipping to (270, 280) 

From frame 601 to frame 650:
- change all channels' front/back clipping to (-300, 300) 

// Reset to low-zoom and full-range clipping
// zoom factor is relative to current zoom, translation must be scaled by the zoom.
From frame 650 to frame 700:
- change all channels' front/back clipping to (-808, 808)
- zoom by a factor of 0.16666 ease-in-out 
- translate by (-4010, 1372, 0) ease-in-out
- rotate by -90 degrees vertically 
- rotate by 180 degrees horizontally 

// Fin: sequential dimming of channels
From frame 700 to frame 750:
- change channel 2 weight to 0 
From frame 750 to frame 800:
- change channel 1 weight to 0 ease-in 
- change scalebar visibility to off
